# Student Attendance using Face Recognition (FYP)

## Problem Definition
Engaging students and ensuring their consistent attendance are essential first steps toward ensuring the success of an educational institution. If you have a higher attendance score, your grades will be higher, your retention rate will be greater, and your educational experience will be improved. When children are absent from school on a regular basis, it is challenging for teachers to develop meaningful relationships with their students. This makes it more difficult for both students and teachers to advance their abilities and make progress. The number of students who attend a given school on average each day is factored into the creation of the budget at many different kinds of institutions. The financial stability of the school is put at risk when enrollment numbers are low. As a result, schools have less money to spend on basic classroom needs for children, which ultimately results in a lower overall level of educational quality. As a result, the educational organization needs to have access to attendance statistics of a sufficient quality. The institute can use the information provided by these data to design policies, programs, and practices that will boost attendance rates. A large number of educatorâ€™s award better grades to pupils who have greater attendance scores as a means of encouraging more students to attend class.

The departments of the university are obligated to keep track of the attendance of students while they are pursuing their studies. It is an essential step in the learning process, and not just for the pupils, but also for the teachers and other staff members.

Filling out the attendance sheet at the beginning of the lecture has been the customary way to handle this matter for many years. However, it is a time-consuming process for the instructor to watch each student during the entirety of the semester, and students have the ability to simply put down the name of another student even if that student is not physically present in the classroom. Engineers have been attempting to incorporate various technology measures in an effort to reduce the occurrence of problems like these and to make things simpler for both the students and the teachers. For example, RFID cards have recently been implemented in the majority of the departments at the University of Pristina in order to fulfil this function. Despite the fact that this was a great deal more useful than the attendance sheets, there were still certain drawbacks associated with using it. Students are able to pass the card along to their classmates without the instructor being any the wiser. Another drawback is that in order to enter the classroom, pupils have to line up in front of the gadget, which takes additional time. This is an inconvenience for everyone involved. It has long been believed that the face is the single trait that cannot be replicated. This project will therefore suggest the use of computer vision techniques for the purpose of face detection and face identification in order to tackle the challenge.

## Why Automated Attendance System?
The primary goal of implementing a student attendance management system in educational institutions like schools and universities is to automate the process of taking attendance. There are, however, a few additional significant reasons why schools should invest in an attendance management system for their students in addition to this one.

### Real-Time Monitoring
Real-time tracking and storage of attendance data is made possible with the assistance of a student attendance management system. In addition to keeping track of student and staff attendance, the system also assists school administrators in managing and monitoring applications for leaves of absence, arrival and departure times, lunch breaks, and vacations for both students and staff members.

### The process of payroll should be automated
If the software for payroll administration and the system for attendance management are combined, then the procedure for calculating payroll can be automated and will go more quickly. The human resources department of the school is able to quickly and conveniently monitor the absences and leaves of absences of staff members at a glance, and based on that data, they can change pay as required.

Utilizing the technology also decreases the likelihood of making mistakes within the payroll system. Due to the fact that the biometric system determines the precise working hours and holidays, the HR team is less likely to make mistakes while tabulating the payroll.

### A Failure to Have a Proxy Present
As a point of concern, students at many schools, particularly those with higher grade levels, manipulate the daily attendance by using proxies, buddy punching, or tampering with records. This is a problem. Because of the one-of-a-kind nature of an individual's biometric information, faking attendance becomes nearly difficult when using a biometric or RFID system that also includes an attendance module.

This eliminates any possibility of a student manipulating the attendance count, ensuring that it is always correct. Additionally, it helps the pupils become more disciplined and on time throughout the day. 

### Instantaneous Communication with the Parents
Schools now have the ability to monitor student attendance and absence using biometric data thanks to the integration of the student attendance management system. This information is updated in real time, and the programmer has the capability to send automated emails and text messages to the parents in the event that their child is absent from school without prior notification. 

### Enhanced Safety and Security in Schools
By implementing a student attendance management system that is equipped with biometric software, the school may ensure that only those students and personnel who possess valid biometric credentials are permitted to enter the building. In addition, the establishment is able to inform the parents of any guests who come to the school throughout the school day and keep track of those individuals.

So, for these purposes we have to use automated attendance system at least in universities. And this project is a positive move to this automation culture.

## Objectives of this Project
This is a project for a bachelor's degree, and at the bachelor's level, the primary emphasis is placed on the final output. Consequently, in this project, we will merge the two components that follow.
- Investigation into a variety of methodological approaches
- Application of the most effective method to the final product

As a result, we are going to merge both of these aspects, and the end result will be the best product possible in the sense of working. The following are the goals that have been set for the project: 
- Detection of face and store it as sufficient number of images.
- Extraction of features for the detected face for further testing process
- Storing of details of a person in a training dataset
- Testing of the faces with the trained image
- Automatic modifications in the files without any other persons.
